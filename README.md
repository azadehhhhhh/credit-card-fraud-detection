This is my practice project for credit card fraud detection using a public dataset.

Goal: Detect fraudulent transactions from highly imbalanced credit card data.

Methods: Supervised machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

Focus: Handling class imbalance and using proper evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC).
I will gradually improve this project by:
Tuning model hyperparameters
Trying different thresholds for fraud classification
Adding more detailed analysis and conclusions
