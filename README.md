# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project is a simple and practical implementation of credit card fraud detection using machine learning.  
The main goal is to explore how to handle highly imbalanced datasets and evaluate models properly for fraud classification.

## Methods Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Class balancing techniques (e.g., class_weight)  
- Evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  

## What I Did
I reviewed an existing public project, understood its workflow, and made my own modifications.  
My next steps include improving the model, tuning parameters, and adding a conclusion section.

## Status
This project is a work in progress and will be updated as I continue experimenting.
